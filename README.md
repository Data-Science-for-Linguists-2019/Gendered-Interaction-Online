## Project Info
Title: Gendered Interaction Online  
By: Katie Thomas

## Brief Project Summary
In this project, I will examine the interaction between different genders in online postings from a sociolinguistics points of view. The data set comes from a study at Stanford University (https://nlp.stanford.edu/robvoigt/rtgender/), but will be modified by me to fit the needs of the project as I progress.

More information about my goals can be found in my [project plan](project_plan.md).
