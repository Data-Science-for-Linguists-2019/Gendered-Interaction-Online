57265377,M,160,"On this day in 1769, George Washington launches a legislative salvo at Great Britain's fiscal and judicial attempts to maintain its control over the American colonies. With his sights set on protesting the British policy of ""taxation without representation,"" Washington brought a package of non-importation resolutions before the Virginia House of Burgesses.  When Britain's House of Lords learned that the Sons of Liberty, a revolutionary group in Boston, had assembled an extra-legal Massachusetts convention of towns as the British fleet approached in 1768, they demanded the right to try such men in England. This step failed to frighten New Englanders into silence, but succeeded in rallying Southerners to their cause. By impugning colonial courts and curtailing colonial rights, this British action backfired: it created an American identity where before there had been none.",photo

57265377,M,272,"Fellow Texan,  Last night, we heard President Obama's State of the Union Address. Thankfully, it was his last.   Yet little had changed last night from the previous seven.  Once again, the president acted like the last few years have been a big triumph for the country.  It's sad to see a leader so unaware of how so much has gone wrong.   Rather than hear another one of his self-important speeches, I wish the president had offered something else: an apology.  Of course, that would have required a very long speech, indeed.   I wish he would have apologized for saying in 2008 that President Bush should have worked with Congress more and relied on executive power less.  Ironic, isn't it? President Obama failed his own standard miserably. Time and again, he blatantly ignored the will of Congress and even sneered that he ""had a pen"" by which he could do what he wanted.   I wish he would have apologized for ignoring the advice of the military and pulling virtually all our troops out of Iraq.  Many people, including President Bush in 2007, specifically warned of a vacuum that would be created in Iraq if we pulled out.  President Bush even warned that what might emerge in that vacuum could be as bad or worse as al Qaeda.  What prophetic words. Thanks to President Obama's decision, ISIS emerged and we will be paying the price for years to come.   I wish he would have apologized for his administration telling the country that Benghazi was the result of a spontaneous protest to a video ... even when his Secretary of State knew almost immediately it was a coordinated terrorist attack.   I wish he would have apologized for his comments in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attack ... when he seemed unemotional and detached except to get angry when talking about Republicans and domestic politics.  The families of the victims deserved better.   I wish he would have apologized for making Iran's path to nuclear power all the easier.  How ironic that on the day the president prepared to deliver his last State of the Union, the Iranians took over two American Navy vessels.  And we are supposed to still trust them on the nuclear agreement?  I wish he would have apologized for telling Americans if they liked their health care they could keep it ... even though he knew no such thing was possible.   I wish he would have apologized for the anemic economy he has presided over.  How sad that Jimmy Carter helped create more jobs in four years than Barack Obama has in seven.   I wish he would have apologized for being a Constitutional law professor who clearly doesn't understand the 2nd Amendment.     I wish he would have apologized for Eric Holder.  The Justice Department was out of control during Holder's tenure.  And nothing speaks to the incompetence more than three words that will haunt the president in history: Fast and Furious.    I wish he would have apologized for helping to poison our politics.  The man who promised to bring us together as president took special joy in ridiculing and demeaning his opponents.  Rather than confront conservative ideas at face value, he went to great lengths to distort our arguments and create straw men argument that he could bludgeon to death.  This was not worthy of his promises in 2008 and this was beneath the dignity of the office.   As I said, this kind of speech, though honest, would have been very long.  But the president has no intention of apologizing because the president has no idea of the chaos he is leaving behind.  He thinks he's done great; that's what all his friends and The New York Times editorial board tell him.  For the rest of us, we live with the toxic results of this administration. And so we must count the days until this presidency ends and until America gets a new president and a new start on the challenges facing our country.   Until then, Mr. President, it's not too late. You still have a year left to realize what to do.  And though you can't reverse your decisions, you can do something else: apologize to America.   In God We Trust,  Roger",status
