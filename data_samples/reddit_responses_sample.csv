digitalife,M,157,GitGudMate,How is the GE altering gameplay? I dont know about you but almost everyone I knew hated going to W2 standing around trying to buy shit in the walls of text. Not only that but half the time you had to rely on a 3rd party website which not every one liked.   As for bonds I dont see this as a bad thing if someone wants to buy membership with their gp why cant they? Not everyone has IRL money they can just go out and spend.,2007scape,,unknown_gender
digitalife,M,158,GitGudMate,1. In the 4 months the GE has been out nothing has been devalued in terms of leveling. I also dont see how the GE negatively affects quests I mean so you can buy an item to finish a shitty quest quicker who cares..? Quests are an optional thing the GE just made it more convenient to get silly items.   2. Sure people use bonds for GP but theres not much you can do now unless you make bonds buyable only on the website. And once you get it in-game its automatically untradeable. But such an action would require a poll (unlikely of passing) so yeah. ,2007scape,,unknown_gender

Baruu,M,406,BioMasterZap,"I agree it isnt the most enjoyable skill, but that doesnt mean it is hated either. Many things in OSRS are a grind and the grind of lightning logs can be just as bearable as the grind of Hunter, Runecrafting, or such. It isnt the act of Firemaking that is enjoyable, but the act of not playing efficient. If all the game is to you is Runecraft or Zulrah for weeks then buy everything to get it over with as quick as possible, the game can get very dull. Grinding is more about the journey and not the destination and not everyone wants to spend the majority of it grinding the same thing over and over for money because it is efficient.  Also, you never commented on the Infernal Axe. The idea that efficiency is superior and inefficient is moronic is a flawed one. You dont have to be a moron to just want to train Firemaking and not grind Zulrah for 5 hours first. You dont have to be a moron to not do a slayer task without a cannon anymore than youre not a moron for doing a slayer task at Dagannoth Kings. The point of the game should always be to do what is fun, and for many players playing efficient is not fun; it is boring. So for those players, playing efficient is inferior, because it harms the overall experience.

Baruu,M,407,Jenux,"All of that takes time man.. a lot of people work full time/overtime/go to college and would rather waste time and money on a skillcape that they want rather than going out of the way to do it more efficiently because it just isnt that big of a deal to lose time and money on a game that consumes both anyway at a fucking insane rate.. thats all Im trying to say.  I understand that there is a streamlined way to play the game that requires the least amount of time to max cape, and if youre truly going for max cape without using that method, then yes I would also question your sanity. But for casual players, which I think may be somewhere around 30-40% of the playerbase, fun>efficiency.  Both are completely normal ways to play the game. I ran into a highschool friend in the game a few months back and instantly added each other to friends, but I actually had to ignore him after about 2 months of being bothered any time I was grinding for d def inefficiently, killing blue dragons without blowpipe, the list goes on and on and on but the point is I was enjoying that way of playing just as much as the more efficient way.",2007scape,,unknown_gender

You would obviously have to do something about barrows still...   While I originally was way more in favour of the buffer I have only just realized how much I want this, and because of the skilling caps more than the combat level caps. You would have to go about getting everything in such different ways. For example; if you wanted sharks for good food you would have to kill giant mole or KBD or do level 3 clues or something), everything would have to be worked out from scratch giving innovation a massive advantage again (like it was with escapes and methods in the original DMM).  Admittedly massive portions of the game would become dead content. Raw shark drops, magic log drops etc. would be worthless, high level implings, slayer monsters would be unusable by anybody. But it would also revitalize unpopular content - metal dragons would be the only way to get BIS legs as Wyverns are unkillable, but the only way to viably kill these (as Catacombs and Brimhaven dungeon would be VERY dangerous) is as a slayer task, so metal dragon tasks just went from highly undesirable to highly desirable just as one poor example.",2007scape,,unknown_gender

MuhSoggyKneez,M,470,Bilsendorfdragmire,"Nah man. Thats the point. Its slow. You cant make it faster, that would piss off everyone who did it to 99. Im 78 right now and i dont think its slow at all. I focus on the money and the xp just comes along with it. I havent really noticed the leveling. Heres the thing, if you want 50k xp, you can do lavas, but youll lose money. Thats why its perfect. Nothing about runecrafting needs to be changed. Im looking forward to double astrals. The only thing i would be okay with adding, is an enormous pouch that you get at 99 specifically. That way it doesnt piss off  players who are going for 99 and the ones who have 99 can rake in even more money, ( like 15 more essence in the pouch so 136 per inventory of double nats) that would be sick and might be op but who cares. The game is called runescape...runecrafting should be a very significant part of the game.",2007scape,,unknown_gender

george137,M,485,thongmasterb,Nah its 2 minutes because you would be skulled runecrafting in the abyss.    Regardless getting killed by a player makes your items drop for 2 minutes before they dissapear.   If you get killed by a monster sub 20 wild (and unskulled) they stay on the ground for 1 hour.   If skulled your items only stay for 2 minutes no matter what you die from,2007scape,,unknown_gender
