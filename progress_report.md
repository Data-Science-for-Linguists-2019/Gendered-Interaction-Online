# Progress Report

## Preliminary Report (2/7/19)
I created my GitHub repository, wrote a quick README document, and published the project plan. I have a large data set that will work well with my project ideas, and have examined it enough to start gathering ideas on how to clean it up. I also started searching for/thinking about what kind of articles I should read up on for the sociolinguistics aspect.
