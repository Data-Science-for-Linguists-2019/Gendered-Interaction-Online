# Progress Report

## Preliminary Report (2/7/19)
I created my GitHub repository, wrote a quick README document, and published the project plan. I have a large data set that will work well with my project ideas, and have examined it enough to start gathering ideas on how to clean it up. I also started searching for/thinking about what kind of articles I should read up on for the sociolinguistics aspect.

### Data Acquisition and Preliminary Examination
At this point, I have confirmed that the dataset I've been working with (RtGender) is the one I definitely want to use. It is fairly large and contains a lot of information, but is also manageable to handle.

I then moved on to examining the dataset to get a better idea of what I am able to do with it. There are 10 csv files, which I examined pretty thoroughly in my [exploratory data analysis](exploratory_data_analysis/exploring_dataset.ipynb).
